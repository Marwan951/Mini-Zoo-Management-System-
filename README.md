# 🦁 Mini Zoo Management System

A Java-based Zoo Simulation project developed as the final assessment for the **Coursera & Amazon "Introduction to Software Development"** course.

This project showcases key object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like **inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism** — wrapped in an interactive zoo management system with a simple text-based menu.

## 📚 Project Overview

The Zoo System allows users to interact with different animals — each implemented with specific behaviors using Java OOP techniques:

- **Tiger** 🐅 – Inherits from `Animal`, implements `Eat`, and `Walk`
- **Dolphin** 🐬 – Inherits from `Animal`, implements `Eat`, and `Swim`
- **Penguin** 🐧 – Inherits from `Animal`, implements `Eat`, `Walk`, and `Swim`

The program uses:

- Abstract classes
- Java interfaces (`Eat`, `Walk`, `Swim`)
- Method overriding
- Simple text menu (Swing GUI or Console version)

---

## 🧩 Features

- 📜 Menu-based interaction with animals
- 🧠 Demonstrates abstract classes and interface implementation
- 🔁 Polymorphism: method overriding for animal-specific behaviors
- 🐧 Bonus: Penguin class can both walk and swim
- 🖥️ Built using **Java** in **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**
